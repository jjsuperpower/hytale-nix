# Hytale Launcher for Nix

Small derivation to run the hytale launcher on nixos without flatpaks.
It can be run with the following command:
```
nix run github:andreashgk/hytale-nix#hytale-launcher
```

This package currently breaks whenever there is an update available.
When I find a way to disable auto-updating for the launcher I will include this here.
For now, try nix-alien to run this package.
